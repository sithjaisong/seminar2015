%Sample Abstract
%Didymella bryoniae, the fungus that causes gummy stem blight, survives between crops in cucurbit debris. A pesticide that eliminates the fungus from infested debris would reduce initial inoculum for subsequent crops planted in infested fields. Naturally infected, 5-cm muskmelon vine sections were sprayed with field-equivalent rates of three herbicides, four fungicides, six salts, three botanical extracts, or three organic pesticides. After 3 days, vine sections were cut into 1-cm pieces and cultured on 1/4 PDA plus antibiotics. Each pesticide was tested 2 to 4 times with 10 to 20 vine sections per treatment. Chlorothalonil, mancozeb, sodium bisulfite, and pyraclostrobin + boscalid (Pristine) consistently reduced recovery of D. bryoniae to an average of 63, 57, 41, and 8% of vine pieces, respectively, compared to a water-treated control (99%). The other pesticides did not significantly reduce recovery of the fungus. Using Pristine to treat debris at the end of the season is not advisable, because of the risk of resistance to this fungicide. However, a non-specific material, such as a broad-spectrum fungicide or a salt, could be used to reduce the amount of surviving inoculum.

% What is "data science"? That would be the best first sentence or two to orient us.
% Your last five sentences really need to be part of the whole abstract. Integrate the processes don't separate Data Science and epidemiology here. Illustrate the frameworks in tandem, don't make them two parts. The way it reads now, it's redundant.

Data science is the science dealing the data (large dataset) with statistics and computer science. Data generally are raw and need to be cleaned in order to extract meaning from them or solve the problems. There are many methods in data processing that botanic epidemiology can borrow from data science. Epidemiologists often deal with more than one factor possibly causing or contributing to plant disease. Building the models to capture the those relationships and prediction is a useful approach. Temperature, moisture, soil pH, soil type, plant varieties, crop density are some examples of variables considering the causes of plant disease development.  When this number of variables are added for a study, the dataset becomes massive. However, handling and analysis  the large data set combining with various variables is challenge. Realistically, handling and analyzing the large data set requires the computer's capability to process the computations. Statistics is on these processes also. It served to determine the causal effect from data, fit the model, for example. The data science processes thus server to open new opportunities for future approaches to studies of botanical epidemiology.
