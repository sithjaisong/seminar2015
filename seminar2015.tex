%Sample Abstract
%Didymella bryoniae, the fungus that causes gummy stem blight, survives between crops in cucurbit debris. A pesticide that eliminates the fungus from infested debris would reduce initial inoculum for subsequent crops planted in infested fields. Naturally infected, 5-cm muskmelon vine sections were sprayed with field-equivalent rates of three herbicides, four fungicides, six salts, three botanical extracts, or three organic pesticides. After 3 days, vine sections were cut into 1-cm pieces and cultured on 1/4 PDA plus antibiotics. Each pesticide was tested 2 to 4 times with 10 to 20 vine sections per treatment. Chlorothalonil, mancozeb, sodium bisulfite, and pyraclostrobin + boscalid (Pristine) consistently reduced recovery of D. bryoniae to an average of 63, 57, 41, and 8% of vine pieces, respectively, compared to a water-treated control (99%). The other pesticides did not significantly reduce recovery of the fungus. Using Pristine to treat debris at the end of the season is not advisable, because of the risk of resistance to this fungicide. However, a non-specific material, such as a broad-spectrum fungicide or a salt, could be used to reduce the amount of surviving inoculum.

% What is "data science"? That would be the best first sentence or two to orient us.
% Your last five sentences really need to be part of the whole abstract. Integrate the processes don't separate Data Science and epidemiology here. Illustrate the frameworks in tandem, don't make them two parts. The way it reads now, it's redundant.
Data science is the science of dealing with data to extract meaning and data product by combining statistics and computer science. Scientists in many disciplines are paying attention to massive data sets which are dramatically generated, accumulated and stored  via the technology such as high-throughput genomic sequence, smart phone etc. In order to handling these data, computer science is very helpful. Additionally, statistics will be applied for making the decision. Whereas a traditional data analyst may look only at data from a single source (a set of experiment), data science will enable us explore and examine data from multiple disparate sources.  As a plant epidemiologist, we struggle to search for the causes of disease epidemics. To investigate the causation, we analyze the data by combining the record data of temperature and relative humidity from difference locations with the disease epidemic. Practically, data analysis process involves data manipulation, sometimes called wrangling or munging, which is the part of computer science and then may come up with the modeling. Because either the data or the tools to analyze didn't exist before, the technique of data science potentially enable plant epidemiologists discovering a previous hidden insight from many angles.
