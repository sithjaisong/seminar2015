%Sample Abstract
%Didymella bryoniae, the fungus that causes gummy stem blight, survives between crops in cucurbit debris. A pesticide that eliminates the fungus from infested debris would reduce initial inoculum for subsequent crops planted in infested fields. Naturally infected, 5-cm muskmelon vine sections were sprayed with field-equivalent rates of three herbicides, four fungicides, six salts, three botanical extracts, or three organic pesticides. After 3 days, vine sections were cut into 1-cm pieces and cultured on 1/4 PDA plus antibiotics. Each pesticide was tested 2 to 4 times with 10 to 20 vine sections per treatment. Chlorothalonil, mancozeb, sodium bisulfite, and pyraclostrobin + boscalid (Pristine) consistently reduced recovery of D. bryoniae to an average of 63, 57, 41, and 8% of vine pieces, respectively, compared to a water-treated control (99%). The other pesticides did not significantly reduce recovery of the fungus. Using Pristine to treat debris at the end of the season is not advisable, because of the risk of resistance to this fungicide. However, a non-specific material, such as a broad-spectrum fungicide or a salt, could be used to reduce the amount of surviving inoculum.

% you overuse "The". For instance, "for extracting THE knowledge from data". It should be "extracting knowledge from data", but to be more accurate, it should be "information from data" as data isn't conscious and therefore cannot have knowledge.

% Also here: "understand the online social relations", it's not necessary and sounds weird. Should just be "understand online social relations". 

% Check your names, Tweeter? That's a speaker...

% "but they are facing challenge with handling and processing big data." They is plural. Challenge is singular. This is something I already mentioned to you once.

% "It involve" your subject-verb agreement is wrong here.

Data science is the science adopting the techniques and theories from broad areas of mathematics, statistics and computer science for extracting information from data, which are large and complex. Scientists in many disciplines are paying attention to massive data sets because the data that are generated simultaneously by devices in realtime from our living can reflect our behavior. For example, social scientists used data from user of social network media such as Facebook and Tweeter to understand online social relations, but they are facing challenge with handling and processing big data. In order to manipulate these data, data science is very helpful. Additionally, in part of data analysis, it involve a range of tools to perform predictive analytics including statistical modeling, classification and regression. Whereas a traditional data analyst may look only at data from a single source (a set of experiments), data science will enable us explore and examine data from multiple disparate sources. As a botanic epidemiologist, we struggle to search for the causes of plant disease epidemics. To investigate the causation, we analyze the data by combining the climatic data (e.g., temperature, relative humidity) and relevant variables from several areas where plant diseases spread with the plant disease epidemiological data. This process will create more data, and consequently they may lead to new extensive result. Because either the data or the tools to analyze the data didn't exist before, data science potentially give botanic epidemiologists the opportunities to discover a previous hidden insight from many angles.
