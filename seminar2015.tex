%Sample Abstract
%Didymella bryoniae, the fungus that causes gummy stem blight, survives between crops in cucurbit debris. A pesticide that eliminates the fungus from infested debris would reduce initial inoculum for subsequent crops planted in infested fields. Naturally infected, 5-cm muskmelon vine sections were sprayed with field-equivalent rates of three herbicides, four fungicides, six salts, three botanical extracts, or three organic pesticides. After 3 days, vine sections were cut into 1-cm pieces and cultured on 1/4 PDA plus antibiotics. Each pesticide was tested 2 to 4 times with 10 to 20 vine sections per treatment. Chlorothalonil, mancozeb, sodium bisulfite, and pyraclostrobin + boscalid (Pristine) consistently reduced recovery of D. bryoniae to an average of 63, 57, 41, and 8% of vine pieces, respectively, compared to a water-treated control (99%). The other pesticides did not significantly reduce recovery of the fungus. Using Pristine to treat debris at the end of the season is not advisable, because of the risk of resistance to this fungicide. However, a non-specific material, such as a broad-spectrum fungicide or a salt, could be used to reduce the amount of surviving inoculum.

% Your first sentence is awkward and unclear
% Dramatically generated? Why is the generation of these datasets dramatic?
% Stored via the technology? 
% I can't imagine a smart phone being used to store big data (yet), why are you suggesting that here?
% "In order to handling" is not proper grammar
% Which decision? Why is it "THE decision"? What does this even mean? 
% A set would be plural? Unless you can point me to a set of items that is a singular?
% "The record of temperature"? You are suggesting that there is only one record of temperature, "THE record"???, why?
% "difference locations"? What does this mean?
% I'm not even sure what you meant with this sentence, "Practically, data analysis process involves data manipulation, sometimes called wrangling or munging, which is the part of computer science and then may come up with the modeling." This needs to be revised for clarity.
% "the technique of data science potentially enable plant" - grammar here is wrong. Also why are you calling us "Plant epidemiologists"? Are you suggesting that we study human diseases that plants cause?


Data science is the science of dealing with data to extract meaning and data product by combining statistics and computer science. Scientists in many disciplines are paying attention to massive data sets which are increasingly generated, accumulated and stored via the technology. For example, many life scientists have tried to study the   high-throughput genomic data,but they are facing challenge with handling and processing big data. In order to manage these data, data science is very helpful. Additionally, it also help making the decision and interpreting the result. Whereas a traditional data analyst may look only at data from a single source (a set of experiment), data science will enable us explore and examine data from multiple disparate sources. As a plant epidemiologist, we struggle to search for the causes of disease epidemics. To investigate the causation, we analyze the data by combining the record data of temperature and relative humidity from difference locations with the disease epidemic. This process will create more data, and consequently they may lead to new extensive result. Because either the data or the tools to analyze the data didn't exist before, the technique of data science potentially enable plant epidemiologists discovering a previous hidden insight from many angles.
