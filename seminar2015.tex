%Sample Abstract
%Didymella bryoniae, the fungus that causes gummy stem blight, survives between crops in cucurbit debris. A pesticide that eliminates the fungus from infested debris would reduce initial inoculum for subsequent crops planted in infested fields. Naturally infected, 5-cm muskmelon vine sections were sprayed with field-equivalent rates of three herbicides, four fungicides, six salts, three botanical extracts, or three organic pesticides. After 3 days, vine sections were cut into 1-cm pieces and cultured on 1/4 PDA plus antibiotics. Each pesticide was tested 2 to 4 times with 10 to 20 vine sections per treatment. Chlorothalonil, mancozeb, sodium bisulfite, and pyraclostrobin + boscalid (Pristine) consistently reduced recovery of D. bryoniae to an average of 63, 57, 41, and 8% of vine pieces, respectively, compared to a water-treated control (99%). The other pesticides did not significantly reduce recovery of the fungus. Using Pristine to treat debris at the end of the season is not advisable, because of the risk of resistance to this fungicide. However, a non-specific material, such as a broad-spectrum fungicide or a salt, could be used to reduce the amount of surviving inoculum.


Pests are the block of  big barrier for agronomist to deal with in order to improve the productivity.  Surveys of farmers' fields are the sources of information to determine the importance of pests. Spearman's rank correlation-based network analysis was conducted to identify the co-occurrence correlations of incidence of insect pest, and disease from survey data which started collecting from the 450 farmers's fields in lowland rice growing areas in five countries including India, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam from 2007 to 2010.  Network analyze revealed interaction among insect pest and disease and strongly indicate the occurrence of their relations. In wet season,  incidence of bacterial leaf streak, the damage of whorl maggot,  the incidence of silver shoot and the number of brown plant hopper showed strong co-occurrence with other pests, and the incidence of narrow brown spot, the number of brown plant hopper, and white backed plant  hopper  showed strong co-occurrence in dry season. The strong co-occurrence of selected pests potentially indicated the key pests to control.
